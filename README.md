Concrete5.7-text-icons
======================

An example Package to easily add text to the toolbar icons in Concrete5.7.

This is intended to be just a quick example package to demonstrate the ability to overcome the lack of text labels in Concrete5.7 in the toolbar. Please feel free to use this code as you see fit, but bear in mind it was built for learning / demonstration purposes at a very early stage in Concrete5.7 as a response to github issue #555 on the Concrete5-5.7.0 repository.
